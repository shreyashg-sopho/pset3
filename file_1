JOB SEARCH ADVISING/COACHING SERVICES AGREEMENT

This Agreement is by and between Labtuit Inc. (“Service Provider”) and _________________ (“Client”)
(each, a “party”; collectively, the “parties”), and is effective on______________(Date). The founder of
Labtuit Inc, Samura Atallah, will be signing this service agreement and her signature is representing the
business, Labtuit Inc, and not her personal capacity to sign. Samura Atallah serves as a Corporate
Officer for Labtuit Inc. Client wishes to have Service Provider supply to Client certain job coaching
services (“Services”) pursuant to one or more addenda to this Agreement (“Services Addenda,” and each
an “Addendum”).
For good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is acknowledged, and
intending to be legally bound, the parties agree as follows:
1. Engagement. Client hereby engages Service Provider to provide Services.
2. Payment.
As of May 2020, we introduced a $199 upfront fee (we updated our website to reflect this) to be
deducted from the 3% fee owed. Once our team sends the Candidate back their updated resume, this
fee is non-refundable and is considered a resume rewrite fee. Top resume services charge $300 for
resume rewrite alone; we added this fee to ensure we only attract candidates who are actively seeking
new opportunities and who will be committed to our program. This is a new change as in the past we
didn’t require it, and ended up attracting users who weren’t committed to the process. Another reason for
this is that despite asking Clients to only sign if they want to put effort/time into the process, we still
encountered Clients who don’t show up on the Resume Call and other Sessions they scheduled. This
means these such Clients
a. take the place of other Clients who are committed and need our service (as we have a wait list),
b. in addition to increasing our costs which results in us investigating increasing our price point to
make up for this sunk cost that we’ll never recover, which we want to avoid as having a service
accessible to many professionals is key to us.
So to eliminate Clients who are not commited, we are requiring this upfront fee.
Client agrees to pay for Services on the following terms:
a) Client will pay for Services if Client is offered and accepts a paid Job in an organization or company
other than the one where the Client is currently employed during the Term of this Agreement (as
defined below). If Client doesn’t accept an offer, there is no fee for the Service, and there is no penalty
for not accepting an offer.
This obligation will apply to only the first Job that the Client is offered and accepts within the
Term (#5), even if the Client’s start date is past the Term.
b) Client agrees to pay three percent (3%) of Client’s pre-tax (gross) first-year base salary in the job to
Service Provider to be paid in 3 installments (one third at the mark of the first month of employment, one
third at the mark of the second month of employment, one third at the mark of the third month of
employment).
If there are any organizations that the Client wants to exclude from the 3% (meaning ONLY organizations
with which Client is in the process of interviewing with, or organizations where Client already has an offer
from), Client has to provide evidence of interviews with these organizations to Labtuit before signing the
contract, so that Labtuit will modify the contract and include them as excluded organizations. If Client
doesn’t do this before signing the contract, Labtuit cannot exclude them after signing the
contract. When modifying the contract, it will explicitly state the terms that apply to roles at these
organizations. Pasted below is info on these roles from our FAQ:

If you are already in the interview process with an organization prior to working with us, we are
still offering you interview prep and negotiation guidance. This is why we offer a discounted rate
of only 1% for these roles you’re already interviewing for before working with us if you
were to land and accept one. Please note that this is for a specific role. We are not offering a
1% fee for entire companies, only the specific roles with these companies for which you are
already interviewing. For any of these situations, you must provide us with proof at time of signing
for all of the positions for which you are currently interviewing. This requires that you’re actively
interviewing with these organizations, and not organizations that you have interviewed with in the
past and are no longer actively interviewing with.
You have to provide us with the name of these organizations and proof that you have an
offer with them or are currently interviewing with them before signing with us for us to
exclude them and write an exclusion statement in your contract.
If you have already obtained an offer before working with us and you want to exclude it
(e.g., you’re not sure if you’ll take it but you want to continue interviewing to see if you can get
something better), we can exclude such positions with the caveat that if you end up
accepting the role that you had previously obtained an offer for before signing with us,
we’ll charge the cancellation fee term ($125/hour) for any time that went into your case.
Alternative payment method: For individuals who would prefer to pay a fixed cost upfront
instead of an income share after getting hired, we offer an upfront fee option of $999-$3000
(based on your profile as we hire more advanced advisors for more advanced candidates, and
the more advanced advisors earn higher pay).
- The fee is due prior to joining. If you’re interested in this option let us know and we’ll share with you
the amount for your profile.
- If you withdraw from the program during the cancellation period, your payment will be refunded and
we’ll only charge you the applicable cancellation fee explained in this contract. If you don’t land a new job
during the term of this agreement, your payment will be refunded.
c) Non-traditional roles. While we work with Clients to help land full-time employment (most of our
candidates want to find full-time roles) , we have encountered cases where Clients prefer different types
of work.
Internships: To join Labtuit as an internship seeker only, upfront payment of $1000 is required.
However, if you are looking for both a full-time job and an internship, you can sign with us with the same
3% structure (without the $1000 upfront fee required).
Commission-only positions: If the Client prefers landing a position that is 100% pay based on
commission, the fee percentage will be calculated based off of the actual yearly income earned and
assuming 75% of it is base pay and 25% of it is a bonus. The percentage fee will be calculated from 75%
of the actual amount earned.
Part-time, contract or hourly roles: If the Client opts to accept a part-time, contract, or/and hourly
position, the compensation amount will be annualized for a 40 hour week and converted to a full-time
amount, and the amount due will be calculated from the full-time amount. For example, if a Client
accepts a part time job for 20 hours a week that pays $30,000 yearly, then this will be converted to a
yearly amount $60,000 covering 40 hours of work, and the amount due will be calculated off of this
amount.
If the Client is offered and accepts a position that doesn’t have an annual salary (for example, a 6-
months’ full-time contract), then the amount that is due will be calculated by annualizing the salary that
DocuSign Envelope ID: B51DEA9C-90F8-4D86-B569-BCB5E6FC3CD4

the Client is offered (for example, if it is a 6-month contract, the annualized salary would be the salary for
the 6 months contract multiplied by 2. The amount that is due would be calculated from the annualized
salary).
Part-time, contract or hourly roles if you intend to continue seeking full-time employment with us:
On a case by case basis, we can opt to apply our policy around certain positions being excluded here

and either (a) exclude the job altogether or (b) ask you to pay a small amount upon accepting the short-
term position to be deducted from the 3% owed on the long-term position that you land and accept.

Under these circumstances, you can continue using the remaining services in your package that you
haven't used yet.
d) Your Payment Term will end upon Payment Satisfaction. The amount due only applies for the first
job you find during the duration of the contract and doesn't apply for any future jobs. After
Payment Satisfaction is met, the remainder of this agreement length is thus terminated.
e) Reporting of all Earned Income. Upon completion of your contract and throughout the Payment Term
and contract duration, you agree to communicate: (i) employment positions you accept; (ii) proof of
compensation offered (for example, your base salary or hourly salary) from your employment positions.
While offer letters usually suffice, we retain our right to ask for other types of documentation (e.g., tax
documents) just to verify income and employment details. If we do ask for such documentation, the
information you shared will be kept confidential and will only be used for the purpose of
calculating/verifying the amount owed.
f) Reconciliation. The following clause will only be used if Client tries and evade paying Service
Provider or if Client doesn't provide proper documentation on employment and earned income:
During the Payment Term, Company shall have the right to examine and audit your records pertaining to
your employment and to verify your Earned Income at any point or points during the Payment Term to
ensure that you have properly reported your Earned Income and to verify that the Company has properly
calculated Payments (“Reconciliation”). You agree to cooperate with the Company in the Reconciliation
process.
g) Confirmation of Earned Income and Employment. The following clause will only be used if Client
tries and evade paying Service Provider or if Client doesn't provide proper documentation on
employment and earned income:
To permit Company to perform Reconciliation, you agree that you shall, within thirty (30) days of request:
(i). verify your Earned Income as reported to the IRS or CRA by completing and delivering to Company
an IRS Form 4506-T or Form 4506T-EZ (or any successor form) or, at Company’s option, provide
Company with a true and accurate copy of your federal tax return as submitted to the IRS or CRA for any
calendar year of the Payment Term; (ii). Provide Company with the name, address and phone number of
any Employers from which you have received Earned Income and authorize each of your Employers to
disclose to us all forms of compensation paid or provided to or earned by you; and (iii). provide such
other documentation including pay stubs, Form W-2s, offer letters, and other information and summaries
of any non-written or written compensation arrangements
h) The following clause will only be used if Client tries to evade paying Service Provider or if
Client doesn't provide proper documentation on employment and earned income:
If Client evades payment or doesn't provide proper documentation on employment and earned income,
Client will be charged a $5,000 penalty in addition to the amount that the Client owes and any
legal/administrative costs that go towards the process of collecting the amount owed. We offer our career
service to our Clients for no money upfront. To make that work, we need to ensure that payments are
made correctly and fairly. If Client tries to evade payment or doesn't provide proper documentation on
employment and earned income, we charge a penalty to cover all of the administrative and legal work
associated with getting paid what the Client owes.
3. Client Obligations.
DocuSign Envelope ID: B51DEA9C-90F8-4D86-B569-BCB5E6FC3CD4

a) Client will provide Service Provider with the following information:
a. Full legal name
b. Date of birth
c. Copy of a valid US state ID, or a valid US driver’s license or a valid passport (just the bio page). We
don’t accept non-U.S. IDs or non-U.S. driver licenses. If you don’t have a valid U.S. ID or a valid U.S.
driver license, we require sharing a valid passport (just the bio page).
d. Phone number
e. Email address
f. Current home address
Client will notify Service Provider promptly if any of the above change.
b) Client will participate in telephone calls with Service Provider. The purpose of these calls is to assure
that Client is progressing with the job search.
c) Client will notify Service Provider within one week of accepting a Job offer and will provide Service
Provider with information on Client’s pre-tax salary.
4. Client Consent. Client consents to:
a) Conversations with Client being recorded only for training and quality control purposes.
b) Service Provider sharing Client’s name, emails, resume, and other documents with other team
members, for training and quality control purposes only.
c) Service Provider obtaining information from Client’s employer using the Authorization to Release
Information attached hereto. This form will only be used if Client fails to voluntarily provide Service
Provider with an offer letter or other confirmation of base salary.
5. Term and Termination. The term of this Agreement (“Term”) will begin on the Effective Date and will
continue for three (3) years. If Client accepts an offer before term completion, the rest of the
contract length is terminated.
[The reason for the contract length of 3 years is because we want to only attract candidates who are
actively looking for a new job. If you want to go to graduate school, we don’t recommend you sign with
us. In the past, we tried custom agreements and shortened the duration, only to discover that there is no
way to enforce that candidate remains active in their job search.]
If the Client pauses the job search for more than 2 weeks (meaning for 2 weeks the candidate doesn't
apply for any position [per the job application tracker] nor is in the process of interviewing for any role
during these two weeks), the number of weeks where the job search was paused will be added to the
duration of the contract. This is why we're announcing upfront we only work with active candidates
(candidates actively exploring new opportunities).
Client may terminate the Agreement anytime in the first 15 days by paying a cancellation fee of
$125 for each hour spent on Client-related work. This is to cover service costs. If you cancel
before you complete any session or mock or check-in, we charge a flat one hour work of work
$125 to help cover our admin costs of setting you up and assigning advisors to work with you.
6. Disclaimer of Warranties. Services furnished under this Agreement are provided "as is" without
representations or warranties of any kind, either express or implied. To the fullest extent permitted by
law, Service Provider disclaims all warranties, express, implied or statutory, including, but not limited to,
implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. Service Provider has no
responsibility for Client’s job performance.
7. Limitation of Liability. In no event shall Service Provider be liable to the Client or any other party for
any special, exemplary, incidental, or consequential damages, including but not limited to lost profits,
whether arising out of contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise. In no event shall Service Provider’s
liability to Client exceed amounts paid by Client to Service Provider during the six (6) months preceding
the date upon which a claim arose.
DocuSign Envelope ID: B51DEA9C-90F8-4D86-B569-BCB5E6FC3CD4

8. Actions. No action, regardless of form (including in contract, tort or otherwise), arising in connection
with the performance of this Agreement may be brought by either party more than one (1) year after the
date of the occurrence on which the action is based.
9. Publicity. Service Provider may include Client’s first name and general case study information within
Service Provider’s marketing materials (general case study information will not reveal the identity of the
Client. If you have a very unique first name, we’ll change your first name in the marketing materials). Any
other use of Client’s name will be subject to Client’s prior written approval, which may be in the form of
an email.
10. Advice of Counsel. Client has had the opportunity to ask questions about this Agreement and to
obtain advice of counsel before and after signing.
11. Miscellaneous. This instrument, with attached exhibits, contains the entire agreement of the parties
and supersedes any previous agreement on the same subject matter between them. No amendments or
variations of the terms and conditions of this agreement shall be valid unless the same are in writing and
signed by all parties hereto. Service Provider is an independent contractor and nothing herein shall be
construed as inconsistent with that relationship or status. If any one or more of the provisions contained
in this Agreement is for any reason held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect the other provisions hereof and this Agreement
shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision had not been contained herein.
Service Provider shall not be liable to Client for any failure or delay caused by events beyond Service
Provider's control. The headings contained herein are for convenience of reference only, and are not to
be used in interpreting this agreement. This agreement shall be construed and enforced pursuant to the
laws of the State of California. Client expressly consents to personal jurisdiction in the state and federal
courts located in California for any lawsuit arising from or relating to this Agreement, without regard to
Client’s then-current residence or domicile. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall constitute
but one document. Any provision of this Agreement or an Addendum which expressly or by its nature is
intended to survive its expiration or termination, including Client’s payment obligations, will survive its
expiration or termination.
12. Personal Information. Labtuit agrees not to use personal or financial information concerning Client for
any purposes other than (i) as expressly authorized herein or as separately agreed to by Client, (ii) as
incidental to the performance of this Agreement, or (iii) to enforce its rights under this Agreement.

SERVICES ADDENDUM #1 - PLEASE READ CAREFULLY
If you (the Client) don’t want to take advantage of what we offer, please do not sign. We want this
agreement to benefit you. We started Labtuit because we are passionate about helping
candidates find the best opportunities they deserve. But this requires some effort from you!
If you opt not to take advantage of what we offer, this is your choice and the 3% charge will still
apply (irrespective of how you land the role, including if it is from a position where you didn’t use
the resume we optimized for you or from a position that you got connected to from one of your
contacts, or anything else). The reason for this is that we have to hire more advisors as we sign
more users so we can provide the best quality for you. Some of our costs are fixed irrespective of
the extent to which each user takes advantage of what we offer. This is why we encourage you to
only sign up if you are actively exploring new job opportunities and you want to put in the
time/effort to land your best job.
DocuSign Envelope ID: B51DEA9C-90F8-4D86-B569-BCB5E6FC3CD4

Career advising services “Package” include up to the following:
● 1 Resume rewrite. You can request unlimited revisions/edits to the 1 resume rewrite, but once
you approve/confirm the final version, we cannot make additional edits.
● 7 one-on-one sessions including sessions on job search strategy, networking/referrals and
interview prep (We used to have an optional career discovery session but for now we’re no longer
offering it).
- We require you finish the 7 sessions in the first 8 weeks of signing or faster (we can move
as fast as you’d like us to move in these sessions as some candidates want to find their
next job asap).
- If you don’t finish these 7 sessions within the first 8 weeks of signing, you lose them.
- If you want to extend the number of weeks you have to complete these sessions (e.g., a
sudden personal situation arises), you must notify us in advance and not after these 8
weeks have passed, so we’ll offer you an extension.
- Please note that if you miss a session you have scheduled without notifying us at least 24
hours in advance, we cannot reschedule your call. Our advisors set aside time on their
calendars to take these calls, so we ask that you honor the time you booked. If you need
to reschedule or cancel, you must do it at least 24 hours in advance by using the
“reschedule” or “cancel” buttons on the Calendly calendar invite you’ll receive, and NOT
through email.

● Negotiation help via email (unlimited) to help you optimize your offer once you’re in the stage of
getting an offer. Before the stage of getting an offer, we provide written best practice guidance
that we share for all candidates.
● 5 Check-ins - these are brief calls where we discuss your progress and problem solve what you
could be doing better in your search
● 5 mock interviews which are divided into the below:
* 3 mock interviews covering: alignment (how your experience and skills align with the role) and
behavioral. These types of questions usually appear on phone screens and first round interviews.
These interviews are with a career advisor.
* 2 mock interviews covering role-related knowledge. These interviews are with an industry
advisor (meaning an advisor who has role-related knowledge/skills) and must be requested 5
business days in advance. (While we usually secure them in less time, we ask that you give us
this time frame to be on the safe side.) These interview types can be:
a. technical if you are interviewing for a technical role such as software engineering or
data scientist etc.
b. nontechnical such as a case interview or investment banking or product management
interview etc.

● An email outreach service where we identify professionals in the companies you’ve applied to,
find their email address and send them the initial outreach email (that you've approved) from an
email address that both you and our team has access to. This is where we will send networking
emails for job application URLs that you've added to your Tracker. In rare cases, we might not be
able to find publicly available emails for these professionals, in which case we cannot send the
outreach email. But these are rare cases. Our team will check your Tracker and perform
updates/send emails at least once per week.
DocuSign Envelope ID: B51DEA9C-90F8-4D86-B569-BCB5E6FC3CD4

The average response rate is 15-20% but this can be higher or lower based on your profile and
other factors. We cannot guarantee the response rate you’ll get as this is outside of our control.
What we can guarantee though is us doing our job and doing the reach out.
- The reachout happens once every 2-5 business days. This means if you input new
positions in your tracker on Monday at 6 pm ET, the reachout will happen (at the latest) by
next Monday at 6 pm ET
- While we try to find relevant professionals for the role itself, a lot of the time this isn’t
possible (for example, we might find a relevant contact on Linkedin but not be able to find
their publicly available email address). While our team continuously try to improve the
relevance of the leads, we cannot guarantee it especially that in some cases, it is literally
impossible to find a relevant lead

● Email drafts for your outreach message and follow ups. You can request unlimited revisions/edits,
but once you approve/confirm the final version, we cannot make additional edits. Our team will
send initial outreach messages and provide you with follow-up templates. You will be responsible
for following up with any contacts who do not respond to the initial connection message, if you
choose to do so.
● A Tracker for jobs and referrals
● Self-guided material on various job search topics – some of this is publicly available and some is
our own creation. We opted to use some publicly available resources as we don’t want to reinvent
the wheel. We created our own material when we didn’t find what we deemed as best practice
synthesized material online.

What we do NOT offer
● We no longer offer email support for our users as we found getting on a call is much more
effective/efficient. Email support will only be used for:
-any edit requests you’d like us to make as we rewrite and finalize your resume. You can request
unlimited revisions/edits to the 1 resume rewrite, but once you approve/confirm the final version,
we cannot make additional edits and cannot respond to requests to make additional edits.
-any edit requests you have on your outreach message. You can request unlimited
revisions/edits, but once you approve/confirm the final version, we cannot make additional edits
and cannot respond to requests to make additional edits.
-any questions you have on negotiation when you’re in the stage of getting an offer only. Before
getting an offer, we share with you the guidance we recommend on how to answer questions
where they ask about salary expectations. Once you’re in the offer stage, we offer unlimited
email support. But before that, we don’t.
If you send us an email that doesn’t fall into the above, you won’t receive a response as
we cannot answer it. Instead, you can use any of the above to get your matter addressed
(e.g., check-in call with us, a mock interview or a session).
